# What is computer science?

- Computer science is fundamentally problem solving, but we’ll need to be precise and methodical.
- We can think of problem solving as the process of taking some input (a problem we want to solve) and generate some output (the solution to our problem).
  ![Input → Process → Output](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/0/input_output.png)
- To begin doing that, we’ll need a way to represent inputs and outputs, so we can store and work with information in a standardized way.
